# Learning List

**A curated collection of learning resources, blogs, and roadmaps I use to continuously upskill.**

This repository acts as my **learning hub**, where I collect and organize everything that contributes to my growth, from insightful blogs and technical articles to structured roadmaps and guides. Each item is tracked as a GitHub Issue, making it easy to categorize, revisit, and expand over time.


## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- Centralize all learning materials I plan to study or have studied.
- Track learning history using GitHub Issues with appropriate tags.
- Keep a personal knowledge base for quick reference and future revision.
- Share a transparent record of the resources shaping my expertise.

## ðŸ—‚ How It Works

1. **Add Learning Items**  
   - Each blog, guide, or resource is added as a **GitHub Issue**.
   - Issues include context, notes, and useful links.

2. **Categorize with Tags**  
   - Tags like `Research Paper`, `System desing` ,`Security`, `DSA`, `AI/ML` help classify topics.

3. **Track & Revisit**
   - Each learning resource is logged as an issue.
   - After consuming the resource, concise notes or key takeaways are added as comments to the issue.
   - The issue is closed once the topic/resource is fully completed.
   - Closed issues serve as a quick reference for revision or when mentoring others.
